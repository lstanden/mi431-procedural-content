# Overview

This is a simple Minecraft terrain generation project loosely based on the Youtube series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h66IN1Pndd0&list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWEJ-5eMtXsYp03Y9yF1dEn

It uses very little of the code written in that project, as I wanted to start fresh and challenge myself to write most of the logic without referring to the original code.
